![](https://github.com/Whalesjr1/Final-Year-Project-Healthcare-Management-System-/blob/main/Screenshot/Screenshot%20(1).png)

Simple web project that made for Health-Nestor.
This project facilitates online doctor appointment requests from clients or patients of a particular medical facility, such as a clinic or hospital. Additionally, this initiative can assist physicians in scheduling patient appointments. Each patient's appointment schedule will be arranged by this doctor's appointment system and then forwarded as a request to the doctor of their choice. The patient, the doctor, and the administrator make up the three sides of the system. The list of doctors will be updated by the system administrator with their specialisations, personal information, and login credentials. The patients will search for a physician who specialises in their needs by browsing the website of the doctor's appointment system. In order to select a day and time for their appointment that works for them, the patient can review the doctor's weekly schedule before submitting their request. Following that, the doctors have access to all of their appointments as well as the patients' requests for appointments based on their availability.
